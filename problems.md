## Problems

Pass test cases by implementing the functions in `code.py`. You need to use NumPy which is a Python library for scientific computing. You will use Numpy for all the assignments throughout this course. Read this tutorial first to learn about Numpy: https://jalammar.github.io/visual-numpy. 

Afterwards, follow the Jupyter Notebook, HW0 Outline, and complete the tasks given, implementing the functions as they become necessary. It is recommended that you use Jupyter Lab instead of Jupyter Notebook because when you update the code, it will automatically update in Jupyter Lab, and not Jupyter Notebook. Within the Jupyter Notebook, there are tips of how to use Jupyter Notebook, as well as a guide to Python!

After you finish implementing all that you need to finish the Jupyter Notebook, (where there are no NotImplementedErrors, and everything is correct), then you will write a report using the overleaf template given to you. Within this template, please don't forget to include the link to your github repo!

   Notebook: https://jupyter.org/install
   
## What to turn in
Turn this report in, which contains the github repo of the updated Jupyter Notebook, as well as code needed to run the notebook within `src`! This means you should remember to push everything to your github repo as you work to make sure you have some safe copy turned in, if you might miss the deadline!

Do NOT upload the github repository to canvas. All we need is the final report which includes the LINK to your repo.
